# Web/Mobile HTML Builder & Editor üöÄ
### No-code HTML builder for your web and mobile apps based on [AWDEV](https://www.awdev.eu.org) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

###### Built for you by [Builder](https://awdev.eu.org/builder/index.html)) with love ü§ç

Feel free to use as-is, and contribute (it's really easy):

ü•á[ONLINE BUILDER](https://awdev.eu.org/builder/index.html)

## Summary
`TL;DR` Simply click ONLINE BUILDER and start building your HTML page.

-- Currently, to change components content click the component settings (cog wheel) then use this ugly hack: click "update" then add a character to the following input, then hit "tab" to update your component. 
Feel free to provide a better way --

Click the `</>` button to inspect and copy your HTML and CSS.
Paste code in your app and don't forget to add DaisyUI and Tailwind CSS in your html page, in the `header`:
```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/daisyui@2.38.1/dist/full.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
```
Auto-saves on your browser, no need to save!
